Our Security, Our Rights

On June 21, 2019, an Act respecting national security matters (the National Security Act, 2017) received royal assent.

This legislation modernizes and enhances Canada’s security and intelligence laws by providing our agencies with the clear constitutional and legal framework they need to do their work effectively while safeguarding Canadians’ rights and freedoms.

The National Security Act, 2017 accomplishes three important objectives:

Enhancing accountability and transparency
The results of the public consultation on national security demonstrated a demand from the public for increased accountability and greater transparency on national security matters. The National Security Act, 2017 addresses this demand in a number of ways as outlined in this section.

Fulfilling commitments to address former C-51
Canadians were clear in the consultation they expect their rights and freedoms to be protected at the same time as their security. The measures outlined in this section demonstrate how the National Security Act, 2017 addresses the problematic elements of former Bill C-51.

Strengthening security and protecting rights
As the threat environment has evolved, so too must the legislative landscape and the political environment in which it operates. The measures outlined in this section demonstrate how the National Security Act, 2017 strengthens Canada's ability to address new threats and safeguard Canadian's rights and freedoms.
